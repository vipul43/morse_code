`main display`: ASCII characters(just some subset of it, not allðŸ˜…) are displayed here.<br>
`input text area`: Try to guess the morse string of the displayed character. The text box only accepts morse characters.<br>
`morse characters`: Morse characters are `'.'` and `'-'`. <br> 
`submit button`: Submits the entered morse string corresponding to the displayed character. If no string is entered then message dialog box is displayed. If wrong morse string is entered, same character is redisplayed again(just not changing the letter thats itðŸ˜‚). If correct morse string is entered then, displayed character is changed.
`next button`: Generated another ASCII character.
